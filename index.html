				<h3>Get Enterprise</h3>

				<p>Current Version: 0.2.1</p>

				<p>Enterprise can be obtained from the official repository on Github.
				Click on the links below to be directed to the appropriate pages:</p>

				<p><strong>Stable:</strong></p>

				<p>There are currently no stable releases.</p>

				<p><strong>Unstable:</strong></p>

				<p><a href=
				"https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise/releases/download/v0.2.1-beta2/Enterprise-0.2.1.tar.gz">
				Version 0.2.1</a> (14 November 2014)</p>

				<p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Version 0.1.1</a> (19 December 2013)</p>

				<p><a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise/archive/master.zip"
				target="_blank">Current Source on Github</a></p>

				<p>Please note that obtaining Enterprise in this fashion means doing lots
				of setup work. If you simply want to create a bootable USB, please
				consider using <a href="http://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/"

				<h3>What Is Enterprise?</h3>

				<div>
					<iframe src=
					"http://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=sevenbits&amp;repo=enterprise&amp;type=watch&amp;count=true&amp;size=small"
					width="150" height="20" style="float: left;"></iframe> <a href=

				</div><br class="clear">

				<p>Enterprise (named after the Starship Enterprise from <em>Star
				Trek</em>) is an EFI program that is designed to assist in booting Linux
				distributions from USB sticks on Intel Macs, something that is
				continously regarded as being near to impossible due to quirks in Apple's
				EFI implementation and really quite poor support from Linux
				distributions. Using Enterprise, you can create bootable USB drives
				that boot on your Mac <strong>without</strong> needing rEFIt or
				rEFInd to be installed.</p>

				<p>The program is quite unique. It is written in C, and can be compiled
				to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit EFI firmware types. Right now, all
				official downloads are for <strong>64-bit EFI firmware architectures</strong>
				only. Be aware that certain 64-bit Macs have 32-bit EFI firmwares, and
				the supplied Enterprise binaries won't work on these platforms.</p>

				<p>Enterprise is designed to compliment <a href=
				"http://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/" target="_blank">Mac
				Linux USB Loader</a>, though it can also be used separately (albeit with
				some setup work). The purpose of Enterprise is as the first stage in a
				two-stage booting process for Mac Linux USB Loader-created USB
				drives.</p>

				<p>Please note that this page is oriented for technical users, such as
				hardware and/or software enthuasists, programmers, and people who like to
				hack their firmware. It is not intended for casual users - beware!</p>

				<h4>The Basics</h4>

				<p>Once upon a time, everything was happy in computer-land. Our PCs were
				booting, our memory sufficed, and the children were happy. But then Mr.
				Turing had to curse us with the &lt;sarcasm&gt; evil of technological
				progress &lt;&#8260;sarcasm&gt;, and eventually our nice, peaceful
				solutions didn't work anymore. All of a sudden, our multi-terabyte drives
				couldn't be booted from, and our old 16-bit BIOSes couldn't boot our
				cool, newfangled 64-bit multicore operating systems. Woe was us!</p>

				<p>But our computer engineers, clever as they are, dug up an old, largely
				forgotten future-proof boot specification, UEFI. And from there, the rest
				is history.</p>

				<h4>Installation and Use</h4>

				<p>Enterprise is intended as a tool to be used alongside Mac Linux USB
				Loader, and so it is not really intended to be installed in the same
				manner as one would install a traditional bootloader like GRUB. That
				being said, it is possible to use Enterprise without Mac Linux USB
				Loader, as they are wholly separate tools, however in this circumstance
				additional setup is required.</p>

				<p>To get the best performance from Enterprise, and to take advantage of
				any super cool stuff I add to it, you should
				<a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise/archive/master.zip">download the
				source code</a>, as the official repository includes a number of tools
				to assist in setup.</p>

				<p>However, for beginners and casual users, you should begin by
				downloading the Enterprise binaries. You can do that at the pane to the
				left. Then you need to set up a configuration file on your USB drive
				under the EFI/BOOT directory (which should be created if it doesn't
				exist) named <em>.MLUL-Live-USB</em> which tells Enterprise details about
				the distribution that you want to boot from your USB drive. Here's a
				sample file:</p>
				<!--<p>
					<div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
						<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
# Lines beginning with a pound sign are comments. They are ignored during parsing.
family Ubuntu
kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi</pre>
					</div>
				</p>-->
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/SevenBits/466f078ac3dfbd028a4b.js"
				type="text/javascript">
</script>

				<p>At the very minimum, you need <em>at least</em> the
				<code>family</code> parameter. This tells Enterprise which distribution
				you are trying to boot and loads default options based on this. All of
				these default options can be overwritten. The default options for each
				parameter are:</p>

				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Distribution</th>

							<th>Default Values</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>

					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Ubuntu</td>

							<td><strong>kernel:</strong> /casper/vmlinuz
							<strong>initrd:</strong> /casper/initrd.lz</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Debian</td>

							<td><strong>kernel:</strong> /live/vmlinuz
							<strong>initrd:</strong> /live/initrd.img</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<p>Naturally, the <code>kernel</code> and <code>initrd</code> parameters
				can be altered by adding the respective line to the
				<em>.MLUL-Live-USB</em> file. This is demonstrated above with the
				<code>kernel</code> parameter. You can pass a variety of additional
				options, including:</p>

				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Parameter</th>

							<th>Effect</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>

					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>entry</td>

							<td>Used to support booting multiple distributions from one
							Enterprise installation.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>family</td>

							<td>Specifies the distribution family (e.g Ubuntu, Debian,
							etc) and sets the other options accordingly. This parameter
							is required if you do not want to specify any other
							options.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>initrd</td>

							<td>Specifies, relative to the root of the ISO, the absolute
							path to the Linux initial RAM disc.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>iso</td>

							<td>The path to the ISO that you wish to associate with this
							particular entry relative to the location of the Enterprise
							binary. If not specified, it defaults to
							<code>boot.iso</code>.<br>
							<strong>Warning:</strong> The behavior of this parameter may
							change in the future.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>kernel</td>

							<td>Specifies, relative to the root of the ISO, the absolute
							path to the Linux kernel.<br>
							<strong>Note:</strong> It is possible to pass custom options
							to this kernel by specifying them after the path. See above
							for an example.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>root</td>

							<td>Specifies the location of the kernel and initrd. Passed
							to the Linux kernel as <code>boot=XXX</code>, where XXX is
							the value of this parameter.</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<h4>Contributions</h4>

				<p>For those of you in the know, I code using a style called <a href=
				"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS" target=
				"_blank">1TBS</a> - or, the one true brace style. I quite like it. So
				much so, in fact, that it's the required syntax style (just so things
				don't get messy). For those of you who are not familiar with it, it is
				best demonstrated with an example:</p>

				<div style=
				"background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
				<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">if</span> (<span style=
"color: #007020">true</span>) {
		bob();
} <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">else</span> {
		sam();
}
</pre>
				</div>

				<p>That should suffice for an explanation. Looking forward to seeing how
				everyone uses this!</p>
